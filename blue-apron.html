				Problem
			</div>

			<div class="space-32px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				Blue Apron was one of the very first meal-kit services to enter the US market but had found that they were <span id="high">not gaining new customers at an adequate rate</span>, and were even having <span id="high">trouble retaining its existing customers</span>. I was brought in to <span id="high">understand the competitive landscape, identify core issues with Blue Apron‚Äôs product/positioning, and suggest changes they could make</span>.

				Methodology
			</div>

			<div class="space-32px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				This was a <span id="high">heavily quantitative-focused</span> project because <span id="high">scale of data was important</span> in making decisions in this space. We used a mixture of: <span id="high">social listening, audience segmentation, competitive analysis, brand-passion indexing, and Google Trends analysis</span> to paint a complete picture.
				<br><br>
				This was a <span id="high">unique case in which research was relatively siloed from the client</span> themselves. This meant that I <span id="high">had to be scrappy with data</span> points like <span id="high">using Google Trends data as a way to map out ‚Äúintent to purchase‚Äù in light of proper sales data</span>.

				Impact
			</div>

			<div class="space-32px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				This research <span id="high">helped them understand that their product wasn‚Äôt aligning with a compelling enough consumer ‚Äúneed state.‚Äù</span> Our <span id="high">brand-passion indexing was really instrumental</span> in helping them see the significance of our research because <span id="high">Blue Apron is a direct-to-consumer product in a space where people need to be feel strongly about the brand in order to make a purchase</span>. In order to get consumers to do this, you need to have carved out a compelling niche, but Blue Apron was <span id="high">too generic compared to its competitors</span> which focussed on things like ease of use or health.
