				Problem
			</div>

			<div class="space-32px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				In 2016, LG had launched a new phone, the LG V20, and had <span id="high">noticed sales/reception towards the device were very low</span>. The LG mobile department was still young and <span id="high">hadn‚Äôt formed a research-driven process to product development</span>, instead relying on its engineering as a differentiating factor between its competitors.
				<br><br>
				With the LG V20, they had <span id="high">put a lot of engineering towards its camera hardware</span>, and then <span id="high">built in a ton of manual camera modes</span> to show off its capabilities. They had also leveraged the <span id="high">majority of their marketing messaging around these manual camera modes</span>. I was <span id="high">brought in post-launch to understand why they were not connecting with customers</span>.

				Methodology
			</div>

			<div class="space-32px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				The <span id="high">two main questions</span> we set out to answer were: 
			</div>

			<div class="space-32px"></div>

			<div class="inLineList">
				<div class="bulletPoints">‚ú£</div>  <span id="high">What do people want out of a new phone?</span>
				<br>
				<div class="bulletPoints">‚ú£</div>  <span id="high">What sways their purchasing decision?</span>
			</div>

			<div class="space-32px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				We took a more <span id="high">attitudinal approach to our research because the things that people use on a day-to-day basis aren‚Äôt necessarily the things that grab their attention from a marketing perspective to make a purchase decision</span>.
				<br><br>
				We used a <span id="high">mixed-methods</span> approach to our research. We started with a <span id="high">lit review</span> and  <span id="high">competitive analysis</span> to better understand the mobile camera space for ourselves since we came in as an agency. We then used <span id="high">quantitative methods</span> including <span id="high">surveys and social listening</span> to get an understanding of the overall climate and <span id="high">stack-rank the types of features people wanted in a phone</span>. We then used a <span id="high">focus group to probe deeper</span> into questions that could provide more of a longer nuanced response.

				Impact
			</div>

			<div class="space-32px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				We discovered that <span id="high">manual camera modes were the last thing people wanted</span>. Instead they <span id="high">preferred simple switches and filters from a camera</span>. While it was great that LG had built up amazing camera hardware, we suggested they <span id="high">create more simple ways to use it and an easier to understand marketing message</span> around them. You see Google adopting this strategy in its current line of phones (ie. rather than being explicit about machine learning increasing detail in a dark photo, they simply call it ‚Äúnight sight‚Äù).
				<br><br>
				Beyond that we <span id="high">recommended that they use some of the needs we found were most important</span> in their target market and build features that could attract those customers. This <span id="high">helped them understand how to allocate engineering headcount< towards their next release</span>. We were also able to <span id="high">communicate to them the importance of research in early stages of their product development</span>, as opposed to leaving it as an afterthought post-launch which <span id="high">convinced them to rescope us to lead research for early product development</span> in their next launch.
