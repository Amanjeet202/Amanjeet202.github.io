				If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôm grateful for about the agency environment, it‚Äôs that it has <span id="high">pushed me to learn fast and understand how to work in all kinds of environments with all kinds of people</span>.

			<div class="project-body">
				In 2016, LG had launched a new phone, the LG V20, and had <span id="high">noticed sales/reception towards the device were very low</span>. The LG mobile department was still young and <span id="high">hadn‚Äôt formed a research-driven process to product development</span>, instead relying on its engineering as a differentiating factor between its competitors.
				<br><br>
				With the LG V20, they had <span id="high">put a lot of engineering towards its camera hardware</span>, and then <span id="high">built in a ton of manual camera modes</span> to show off its capabilities. They had also leveraged the <span id="high">majority of their marketing messaging around these manual camera modes</span>. I was <span id="high">brought in post-launch to understand why they were not connecting with customers</span>.

				Methodology
			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				The <span id="high">two main questions</span> we set out to answer were: 
			</div>

			<div class="space-32px"></div>

			<div class="inLineList">
				<div class="bulletPoints">‚ú£</div>  <span id="high">What do people want out of a new phone?</span>
				<br>
				<div class="bulletPoints">‚ú£</div>  <span id="high">What sways their purchasing decision?</span>
			</div>

			<div class="space-32px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				We took a more <span id="high">attitudinal approach to our research because the things that people use on a day-to-day basis aren‚Äôt necessarily the things that grab their attention from a marketing perspective to make a purchase decision</span>.
				<br><br>
				We used a <span id="high">mixed-methods</span> approach to our research. We started with a <span id="high">lit review</span> to better understand the mobile camera space for ourselves since we came in as an agency. We then used <span id="high">quantitative methods</span> including <span id="high">surveys and social listening</span> to get an understanding of the overall climate and <span id="high">stack-rank the types of features people wanted in a phone</span>. We then used a <span id="high">focus group to probe deeper</span> into questions that could provide more of a longer nuanced response.

				Impact
			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				We discovered that <span id="high">manual camera modes were the last thing people wanted</span>. Instead they <span id="high">preferred simple switches and filters from a camera</span>. While it was great that LG had built up amazing camera hardware, we suggested they <span id="high">create more simple ways to use it and an easier to understand marketing message</span> around them. You see Google adopting this strategy in its current line of phones (ie. rather than being explicit about machine learning increasing detail in a dark photo, they simply call it ‚Äúnight sight‚Äù).
				<br><br>
				Beyond that we <span id="high">recommended that they use some of the needs we found were most important</span> in their target market and build features that could attract those customers. This <span id="high">helped them understand how to allocate engineering headcount< towards their next release</span>. We were also able to <span id="high">communicate to them the importance of research in early stages of their product development</span>, as opposed to leaving it as an afterthought post-launch which <span id="high">convinced them to rescope us to lead research for early product development</span> in their next launch.

				Problem

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				Blue Apron was one of the very first meal-kit services to enter the US market but had found that they were <span id="high">not gaining new customers at an adequate rate</span>, and were even having <span id="high">trouble retaining its existing customers</span>. I was brought in to <span id="high">understand the competitive landscape, identify core issues with Blue Apron‚Äôs product/positioning, and suggest changes they could make</span>.

			<div class="project-body">
				This was a <span id="high">heavily quantitative-focused</span> project because <span id="high">scale of data was important</span> in making decisions in this space. We used a mixture of: <span id="high">social listening, audience segmentation, competitive analysis, brand-passion indexing, and Google Trends analysis</span> to paint a complete picture.
				<br><br>
				This was a <span id="high">unique case in which research was relatively siloed from the client</span> themselves. This meant that I <span id="high">had to be scrappy with data</span> points like <span id="high">using Google Trends data as a way to map out ‚Äúintent to purchase‚Äù in light of proper sales data</span>.

				Impact
			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				This research <span id="high">helped them understand that their product wasn‚Äôt aligning with a compelling enough consumer ‚Äúneed state.‚Äù</span> Our <span id="high">brand-passion indexing was really instrumental</span> in helping them see the significance of our research because <span id="high">Blue Apron is a direct-to-consumer product in a space where people need to be feel strongly about the brand in order to make a purchase</span>. In order to get consumers to do this, you need to have carved out a compelling niche, but Blue Apron was <span id="high">too generic compared to its competitors</span> which focussed on things like ease of use or health.

			<div class="project-body">
				<span id="high">Selling the value of research</span> involves being <span id="high">proactive every step of the way</span>. Research is <span id="high">not meant to be a deck full of numbers</span>, it needs to be <span id="high">a process that excites the people on your team</span>.
				<br><br>
				This hasn‚Äôt been something that‚Äôs always worked out and I think especially earlier in your career you rely a lot more on the leadership of the research department to do this for you. But one thing I‚Äôve learned is that <span id="high">in the business world you can‚Äôt just wait around and hope things will happen</span>, you need to <span id="high">step up and make them happen</span>.

				Effective research requires multiple iteration cycles

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				<span id="high">One thing I missed in my work was the ability to see through research over multiple iterations of a product</span>. Whether it was client scope, layoffs at the agency or even resource shifting within our company, there was <span id="high">only ever a couple rounds of iteration< you would be present for</span>. This also makes it harder to build lasting relationships with the people implementing the work that should be driven by your insights and this has really <span id="high">pushed me to want to shift over to a product company</span> to try that out.

				Data strategy as a field is headed towards the direction of data science and is slowly losing that human touch. A <span id="high">big part of steering your career is taking moments to reflect</span>, and I‚Äôve come to realize that <span id="high">I need moments of human connection and empathy to feel alive by the research I‚Äôm doing</span>. Luckily as my career progressed I started to <span id="high">evolve towards a more mixed-methods approach</span> and am now even <span id="high">starting to bring in human-centered design methods into my practice</span>. As I move forward I want to evolve from a data strategist to becoming a mixed-methods UX researcher.
