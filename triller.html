				Key Findings
			</div>
			<div class="space-32px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				I lead a <span id="high">multi-phase study</span> to gather insights and suggest creative ideas for Triller to create a scouting tool for A&Rs (reps of a label that find new talent). Below you‚Äôll find a summary of the top findings as well as links to a report for the studies conducted: <span id="high">1-1 Interviews, Journey Map, Competitive Analysis, Usability Study, and Codesign</span>.

				#1 ‚Äî A&R‚Äôs want a tool that empowers their gut feeling
			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				The current landscape of tools are time-consuming, hard to understand and frankly, in an age where artists are buying fake views/fans, A&Rs don‚Äôt fully trust them. Not only that, but <span id="high">since everyone has the same data, the data no longer becomes a differentiator</span> between labels who are often pitted against each other in bidding wars. <span id="high">A&R‚Äôs are continuously relying on their gut to make decisions and the current landscape of tools isn‚Äôt able to inform that gut decision</span> from a qualitative perspective as that is not their focus and sentiment analysis on these tools do not factor in slang to really understand what people are saying about an artist. We have an opportunity to use our collection of intimate video-based data to empower an A&Rs gut feeling.
			</div>

			<div class="space-48px"></div>

			<div class="project-h2">
				#2 ‚Äî A&R‚Äôs want a tool that adapts to their always-on work schedule
			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				A&Rs expressed that <span id="high">the search for new artists never really turns off</span>, spending many nights going to shows to see potential talent live. In our sessions, they expressed wanting an easy-to-use mobile-first tool that would help them scope out more artists per day. Being that <span id="high">the hunt for new artists is a fun activity to A&Rs</span> (and often what drew them to the field) we have the opportunity to create an engaging tool that can be used in moments throughout their day like when they‚Äôre in line for a show or before they go to bed. <span id="high">With well-timed notifications we can build usage habits throughout the day</span>.
			</div>
			
			<div class="space-48px"></div>

			<div class="project-h2">
				#3 ‚Äî A&R‚Äôs see unique value in Triller to find cross-over acts
			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				A&Rs <span id="high">saw potential in Triller‚Äôs ability to help them understand the ‚Äúcultural value‚Äù of a song/artist</span> through seeing its reception on the platform. They also liked the ability to find <span id="high">crossover acts that may have gained a following through the comedy, fashion, or dance categories on the app</span>. A&Rs see smaller apps like Triller as a valuable source to find unsigned talent early, in contrast to bigger platforms like Spotify or Apple Music.
				<br><br>
				While this unique angle of our app provides value, A&Rs also expressed that features such as benchmarking which are present in competitor apps are table-stake features as A&Rs need a way to justify if an artist is a worthwhile investment compared to other unsigned act.

			</div>

			<div class="space-48px"></div>

			<div class="project-h2">
				#4 ‚Äî A&Rs want to decrease friction in connecting with artists
			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				<span id="high">Getting in contact with artists during engagement process is a huge pain point for A&Rs. This came up in our codesign</span> where they suggested solutions to better inform them of the accuracy of listed out points of contact or even giving them <span id="high">an elevated account on Triller that allowed them to message talent directly on the app</span>. This second suggestion is something Triller is uniquely positioned to do since artist have verified accounts on our app and is <span id="high">in line with the goal of our consumer app to get more artists on to the platform</span>.
