				The transforming role of an A&R

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				The role of an A&R (reps who scout talent for a label) is transforming in an age where music consumption happens at a rapid pace and a new star is born and replaced every couple weeks. A&R‚Äôs now use a new set of digital tools to find artists with bubbling online fan bases that a label sign and profit off of before they are snatched up by another label.

			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				Social video apps like Triller, TikTok, and even Instagram have become a breeding ground for songs to blow up. This has helped both established artists popularize their songs like ‚ÄúPlug Walk‚Äù and new acts rise to fame like Lil Nas X or BoyBoy West Coast. During this pivotal moment, Triller is positioned with a valuable dataset that can be productized to help A&R‚Äôs find new talent.

				This was a self-directed multi-phase study I conducted over the course of a month with mentorship from Basim Al-Baker (UXR lead at Blinkist, previously Soundcloud). The deliverables were a series of decks that addressed 4 research questions:

			<div class="project-body">
			I conducted 1-1 interviews as literature on the topic is quickly becoming outdated. I referenced the Jobs To Be Done Framework as it closely linked to the type of deliverables I would product to answer our research question. Learnings from this phase of the research helped inform me on how to best interface with A&R‚Äôs during more complex methods in later phases like the co-design.
			<br><br>
			I started with cold emails and then used referrals to source A&R‚Äôs from a diverse set of labels. I created a journey map to identify pain points and areas of opportunity contextualized to the overall process, allowing a product team to identify strategic approaches to different areas on the map.

Over the course of the study, I adjusted my questions to hone into different phases of the artist recruitment process to better inform the journey map. I also followed up with early interviewees to fill in the blanks based on the rapport I had built with them.

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				When doing an assessment of the market of tools, I also took into consideration platforms that were well-positioned to enter the market based on their unique assets (ie. Instagram with their data on music posted within the Stories feature).
				<br><br>
				In communicating my results, I broke down competitors by the data sets they were pulling from and their overall strengths and weaknesses. I did this as opposed to a feature matrix as I believe in early product development it‚Äôs important to focus on strategic positioning and finding a gap in the market rather than getting caught up in features. To reinforce this approach, I also contextualized competitors in a brand matrix.

			<div class="project-body">
				Before building a new A&R tool, it was important to answer this question to understand what needs Triller may already be addressing as a product. I started with an open-ended scenario to see their approach to finding new talent on the platform, and then directed them towards specific features to get their feedback.

				An unconventional navigation pattern posed a problem and kept detracting from the A&Rs‚Äô ability to freely navigate. Normally I might ask a team to adjust a prototype if it‚Äôs distracting from what we‚Äôre trying to test. In this case, I reconciled by helping them navigate out of a particular tricky screen if they were stuck for too long, while making sure not to give them answers on how to perform specific tasks that were core to the task at hand. This along with some reassurance that there was no pressure and that they weren‚Äôt being judged helped move things along.

			<div class="project-body">
				With codesigns, I try to keep a couple principles in mind:
			</div>

			<div class="space-48px"></div>

			<div class="inLineList">
				<div class="bulletPoints">‚ú£</div>  Balance creating a fun and open space for ideation with friendly reminders about time constraints

				<div class="bulletPoints">‚ú£</div>  Have a note-taker that can review key themes at the end of each session so that you can focus on asking expanding questions
				<br>
				<div class="bulletPoints">‚ú£</div>  With generative methods (ie. the collage), it helps to show an example to make the task feel approachable and cue participants to the depth of responses you‚Äôre looking for
			</div>

			<div class="space-48px"></div>

In moments like these it‚Äôs important to roll with the punches and respect a participant‚Äôs space.
