				How did this research begin?
			</div>
			<div class="space-32px"></div>
			<div class="project-body">
				I initiated this project under the mentorship of Basim Al-Baker (UXR lead at Blinkist, previously Soundcloud) to tackle a new potential stream of revenue for Triller based on trends in the music industry.
			</div>

			<div class="space-48px"></div>

				The transforming role of an A&R
			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				The role of an A&R (reps who scout talent for a label) is transforming in an age where music consumption happens at a rapid pace and a new star is born and replaced every couple weeks. A&R‚Äôs now use a new set of digital tools to find artists with bubbling online fan bases that a label sign and profit off of before they are snatched up by another label.
			</div>

			<div class="space-48px"></div>

			<div class="project-h2">
				Is Triller positioned to productize their data?
			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				Social video apps like Triller, TikTok, and even Instagram have become a breeding ground for songs and artists to show early trends of popularity before blowing up. I conducted this research to understand if and how Triller could create a product with their valuable data set to help A&R‚Äôs find new talent.

			<div class="project-h2">
				#1 ‚Äî A&R‚Äôs want a tool that empowers their gut feeling
			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				The current landscape of tools are time-consuming, hard to understand and frankly, in an age where artists are buying fake views/fans, A&Rs don‚Äôt fully trust them. Not only that, but since everyone has the same data, the data no longer becomes a differentiator between labels who are often pitted against each other in bidding wars. A&R‚Äôs are continuously relying on their gut to make decisions and the current landscape of tools isn‚Äôt able to (or focused on) informing that gut decision from a qualitative perspective. Sentiment analysis on these tools are unable to understand slang when determining what people are saying about an artist. We have an opportunity to tackle this unmet need.
			</div>

			<div class="space-48px"></div>

			<div class="project-h2">
				#2 ‚Äî A&R‚Äôs want a tool that adapts to their always-on work schedule
			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				A&Rs expressed that the search for new artists never really turns off, spending many nights going to shows to see potential talent live. In our sessions, they expressed wanting an easy-to-use mobile-first tool that would help them scope out more artists per day. Being that the hunt for new artists is a fun activity to A&Rs (and often what drew them to the field) we have the opportunity to create an engaging tool that can be used in moments throughout their day like when they‚Äôre in line for a show or before they go to bed. With well-timed notifications we can build usage habits throughout the day.

			<div class="space-48px"></div>

			<div class="project-h2">
				#3 ‚Äî A&R‚Äôs see unique value in Triller to find cross-over acts
			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				A&Rs saw potential in Triller‚Äôs ability to help them understand the ‚Äúcultural value‚Äù of a song/artist through seeing its reception on the platform. They also liked the ability to find crossover acts that may have gained a following through the comedy, fashion, or dance categories on the app. A&Rs see smaller apps like Triller as a valuable source to find unsigned talent early, in contrast to bigger platforms like Spotify or Apple Music.
				<br><br>
				While this unique angle of our app provides value, A&Rs also expressed that features such as benchmarking which are present in competitor apps are table-stake features as A&Rs need a way to justify if an artist is a worthwhile investment compared to other unsigned act.

			</div>

			<div class="space-48px"></div>

			<div class="project-h2">
				#4 ‚Äî A&Rs want to decrease friction in connecting with artists
			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				Getting in contact with artists during engagement process is a huge pain point for A&Rs. This came up in our codesign where they suggested solutions to better inform them of the accuracy of listed out points of contact or even giving them an elevated account on Triller that allowed them to message talent directly on the app. This second suggestion is something Triller is uniquely positioned to do since artist have verified accounts on our app and is in line with the goal of our consumer app to get more artists on to the platform.

			<div class="project-h2">
				Breaking down the problem
			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				I tried to assess the knowledge gaps from the perspective of the Triller team, making assumptions about what research was most likely to already exist (ie. artist-centered research). I broke this down into 4 research questions:
			</div>

			<div class="space-32px"></div>

			<div class="inLineList">
				<div class="bulletPoints">‚ú£</div>  What is the A&R workflow for signing new talent?
				<br>
				<div class="bulletPoints">‚ú£</div>  What is the current landscape of A&R tools?
				<br>
				<div class="bulletPoints">‚ú£</div>  What is A&R impression of Triller as an artist discover tool?
				<br>
				<div class="bulletPoints">‚ú£</div>  What are A&R pain points and areas of opportunity?
			</div>

			<div class="space-48px"></div>

			<div class="project-h2">
				Working within constraints
			</div>

			<div class="space-18px"></div>

			<div class="project-body">
				Zero budget meant I had to be scrappy with recruitment and choosing research methods. To recruit I used cold emails and referrals from participants. I had to be strategic about my limited time and pull with A&Rs, so I wasn‚Äôt free to use the most ideal methods. For example, a diary study could have given more insight into the temporal process of signing new artists. I also wasn‚Äôt able to buy subscriptions to other products for the competitive analysis and so I read through their product pitch decks and got access to a couple from an A&R I built rapport with.
				<br><br>
				The music industry is notorious for its ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù sense of professionalism and so it was important to be adaptable. During the 1-1 interviews I asked clarifying questions when A&Rs used heavy slang to make sure I was not adding my own bias. Another example was the codesign, where it was held at a participants house to accomodate for schedules and it ended up getting interrupted mid-session by a weed delivery. In moments like these it is important to respect the norms of your participants and keep things moving.

			<div class="project-body">
				During the early stages of product development it‚Äôs important to look at the problem from a holistic perspective and figure out a strategic positioning for your product as opposed to getting caught up in features right away. This thinking informed how I approached the deliverables for this project.
				<br><br>
				I created a journey map to highlight the entire signing process, calling out points of pain, delight and areas of opportunity. I used the Jobs To Be Done framework in my interviews and probed into each separate phase of their process.
